Data Scraping assignment

There are 2 files for the code:

1) Jupyter notebook file with .ipynb extention (Data_scraping.ipynb). In this file the assignment was originally made and can be run using a local host.

2) Python script with .py extention (Data_scraping.py). This file has some additional code than original to ensure smooth running of the script. 
It contains functionality to stop scraping further data (After iterating through atleast 1 pin code) and continue with the program, just like jupyter notebook file

There are 3 CSV files. 

1) asianpaints_data_scraping.csv
All the data scraped is stored in this file

2) nearest_stores.csv
It stores analysis of data i.e. 10 nearest stores to the user after entering user's coordinates

3) district_pincodes.csv
It contains pincodes of all the districts in India, which is imported by the code to extract data from all the stores.
